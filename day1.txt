	tools
	- Saving a cost
	- Saving a time
	- improving a quality	
	-----------------------
	For RUNNING APPS/Software
		for Data Center

	How?
	If you run APPS/Software in Container

	What is Container?
	---------------------------
	is a process of init a USER NS
				with their own
						MNT NS
						PID NS
						NET NS
	is a lightweight complete independent RUN time env for APPS.

What are the components needed to run any Apps/Software?
What are pre req for Apps/Software to run?
===============================================
Hardware
	--> Kernel
	

Kernal
	The kernel is a computer program.	
	TYPE			--------------------------KERNAL--------------------------
		- Namespace		NEEDED		OS ALLOWED		CAN BE
			USER NS		ONE		MANY			MANY
			MNT NS		ONE		ONE			MANY
			NET NS		ONE		ONE			MANY
			PID NS		ONE		ONE			MANY
		- Capabilities	- For user ROOT or Non Root
		- Cgroups - CPU + RAM for PID
		

PC === Personal Computing
=========================================

Evolution of Computing
===============================================================================
1990s				2000						Now
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		How we are running apps?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			INTERNET (Apps running in data center)

PHYSICAL Servers		VirtualMachine					Containers
	
==========================================================================================
Docker Architecture?
=====================================

Human => Docker Client => Docker Server(Deamon) ==> ContainerD --> Kernal
        ========================================
		   Docker Engine

Other tools
=====================
https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/list-of-top-container-runtime-interface-projects/

Docker Coponents
===============================
1. Docker Engine

2. Docker Image
----------------- 
	Collection of file system(s) which includes following...
		ROOT FILE SYSTEM + USER FILE SYSTEM 
		ROOT FILE SYSTEM + USER FILE SYSTEM + APP FILE SYSTEM
	One COpy of image get Mounted with each Container.
	You can create - Many container from one Image
	=== Image is your Apps =====
	such as
		ubuntu
		fedora
		rhel
		centos + java + tomcat + app
	

OS IMAGE
--------------
Contains
	BOOT FILE SYSTEM + ROOT FILE SYSTEM + USER FILE SYSTEM + APP FILE SYSTEM

File System
	Collections of dirs/files for specific purpose.

	BOOT FILE SYSTEM	- KERNAL
	ROOT FILE SYSTEM
	USER FILE SYSTEM	
	APP FILE SYSTEM

3. Docker Registry
	Collection of Repo
	Each Repo has File System(S)
	-- often called as image

	PUBLIC
		hub.docker.com
		google registry

	PVT
		Artifactory
		nexus
		ECR

4. Docker Container
	The moment you RUN an image with docker...
		ONE USER get created & 
				mounted with copy of image
				attached with one pid
				attached with one network

=====================================================================================
Docker Workflow
==============================
The moment - you RUN image...
	
HUmna --> Docker Clinet -> DockerD
	DockerD CHECK and if Image is Exist in Local Registry
	- COntainerD --> Kernal
	
	DockerD CHECK and if Image DO NOT Exist in Local Registry
		- Pull Image into Local Registry 
		- COntainerD --> Kernal

	The moment you RUN an image with docker...
		ONE USER get created & 
				mounted with copy of image
				attached with one pid
				attached with one network
